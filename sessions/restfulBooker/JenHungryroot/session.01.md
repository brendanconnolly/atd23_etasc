# \[Exploring Restful Booker\]

**Time Box** \[min10utes\] estimated time to complete, its ok if you need more/less

**Site Used For Testing** \[https://automationintesting.online/\]

## Context

_Optional_ - Chrome on MacOS using a MacBook Pro, not using dev tools/API monitoring at the moment given the limited time, but I usually would if given more time.

## Notes

- Email entering is frustrating as a US customer.
    - Why is there a subject field at all?  Shouldn't this autofill as a request from the form on the site for contact into?
    - Why is there an arbitrary character limit for that field?
    - Unclear on the phone number limitatios, again likely a UK/European context given the Ministry of Testing background for Mark, the creator.  The phone number I entered is valid for the US but was not accepted.
    - This could auto-format for international numbers, etc, or better request numbers in an international format from the get-go.
- Booking
    - Multiple input errors and issues with the class testing using this site simultaneously, which is prevening bookings for specific periods.
    - I can't actually select a date, unclear if this is because someone else selected a date and did a large multi-select or otherwise.



## Follow Ups

* Would retest without multiple concurrent users.
